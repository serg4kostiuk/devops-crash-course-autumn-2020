```Aeneas was a robust guy,
A kozak full of vim,
Full of the devil, lewd and spry,
There was no one like him.
And when the Greeks had burned down Troy
And made of it, to their great joy,
A heap of dung, he left that waste
Together with some Trojan tramps,
The sun-tanned scamps.
They all took to their heels in haste.

```When he, at last, had reached the land
With his bare Trojan crew so beat,
He asked that goose skin band
If they had anything to eat.
They found some stuff which they consumed
Lest they be pooped when they resumed
Their walk in all directions up and down.
Aeneas stuck close to the shore,
He did not know what he was looking for,
When suddenly he came to a town.```

```
One could detect no end to it.
There was a drove of others:
And Death was followed by an exquisite
Hodgepodge of vicious in-laws and stepmothers.
Stepfathers were there, too, the big cajolers,
And many relatives, high rollers,
Some angry brothers, sisters,
Who liked to quarrel constantly,
And caused bad blood incessantly,
All obstinate persisters.
