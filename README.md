```Aeneas was a robust guy,
A kozak full of vim,
Full of the devil, lewd and spry,
There was no one like him.
And when the Greeks had burned down Troy
And made of it, to their great joy,
A heap of dung, he left that waste
Together with some Trojan tramps,
The sun-tanned scamps.
They all took to their heels in haste.

Now, Venus, not an idle one,
More skillful than the deuce and chic,
Observed how Aeolus was frightening her son
And made him very weak.
She washed herself, put on a smart new dress,
As if for Sunday outing, and not less
Than to a dancing party.
Upon her head she put a brocade hood,
In her kuntush* and in a mournful mood,
She went to Zeus, as always bold and hearty.

The Trojans showed their talents well,
The girls would not withstand
The men's enticements andn their spell.
And so, they were in great demand.
Aeneas lured his ardent lover
To take with him steam bath with shower,
And not without a sin.
Her reason was so opiated,
For she was thoroughly infatuated,
Although shy she had never been.

When Venus noticed Dares in that brawl,
She felt a pain inside her head,
She did not like that sight at all
And said to Zeus: "My darling dad!
Give Dares strength, he is my pet,
Lest they humiliate him and upset,
He should defeat his foe, it is imperative,
Because when Dares dies,
The world will nevermind my cries.
Please, make him healthy, let him live!"

Good-by for now, my precious one!
It starts to dawn around.
Good-by, my child, good-by, my son!"
He sank beneath the surface of the ground.
Aeneas started from his sleep
And, trembling, was up in a leap,
His body was damp from cold sweat.
He gathered his band all together
And ordered them regardless of the weather
To sail, determined and dead set.

Aeneas, seeing such a beauty,
Became unnerved and did not know
Where he arrived. He thought his work and duty
Were lost forever. What a blow!
The scarecrow came to him
And uttered like a cherubim
While parting her blue lips:
"How are you, dear? Long time no see!
Oh, you, Anchises' progeny!"
And put her hands upon her bony hips.

Inside, Aeneas started
To bow to Feb, who looked so grim.
He begged that blessings be imparted
From heaven down on him.
Sivilla changed: her orbs somehow
Crept out onto her brow,
Her hair stood up on end,
Her mouth was frothing,
Her body wildly tossing,
As if the devil made her bend.

```The sad Aeneas listened to
Sivilla's babbling stuff.
He clasped his head, stood there and knew
He was fed up and said: ""I've heard enough!
You are annoying me and I
Don't know what you now prophesy'""
He did not like that prattling clod.
'The devil knows who tells the lie,
Perhaps it would not mortify
Me, if I had not begged the god.

```Behind them were some holy men,
Who were not interested to see the world,
Which was beyond their surly ken,
Their hands were on their bellies, furled.
They used to passionately pray
And kept strict fasting every other day.
They never loudly cursed mankind,
But criticized while fingering the beads.
Their days were free of sinful deeds,
At night, their passions would unwind.

```Just like the sediment that foams in kvass,
Or like fermenting red beets turning sour,
Or like above a field of grass
Flies swarming for many an hour,
So were the souls imploring Charon, the Whim,
Extending their soliciting hands to him
To take them on his boat,
But he remained uncaring,
Barbaric, cold and swearing.
That vicious, dirty goat.
