Aeneas was a robust guy,
A kozak full of vim,
Full of the devil, lewd and spry,
There was no one like him.
And when the Greeks had burned down Troy
And made of it, to their great joy,
A heap of dung, he left that waste
Together with some Trojan tramps,
The sun-tanned scamps.
They all took to their heels in haste.

Now, Venus, not an idle one,
More skillful than the deuce and chic,
Observed how Aeolus was frightening her son
And made him very weak.
She washed herself, put on a smart new dress,
As if for Sunday outing, and not less
Than to a dancing party.
Upon her head she put a brocade hood,
In her kuntush* and in a mournful mood,
She went to Zeus, as always bold and hearty.

And when the dance was up,
They drank more brandy with stewed fruit,
Each woman had at least a cup;
They laughed and joked and none stayed mute.
Queen Dido flew into a rage
And broke a pot with beverage.
They drank until the night,
They spent the day elated
And went to bed intoxicated;
The task to drag Aeneas was not light.

The Trojans showed their talents well,
The girls would not withstand
The men's enticements andn their spell.
And so, they were in great demand.
Aeneas lured his ardent lover
To take with him steam bath with shower,
And not without a sin.
Her reason was so opiated,
For she was thoroughly infatuated,
Although shy she had never been.

The runner Mercury bowed low
In front of Zeus, took off his cap,
Rolled o'er the threshold like a gigolo
And scampered to the stable with a snap.
He put away his whip,
Hitched two mares and began to clip
From heaven in a cloud of dust.
And being a supreme taskmaster,
He made the horses run much faster
Until the jig squeaked from the thrust.

Aeneas sailed the bluish sea
And steadily was looking back.
He fought his pain, cried bitterly
As Carthage passed from sight, alack!
Although he sailed from Dido fast,
It seemed that his keen pain would last.
But when he heard that she was burned,
He said: "May she attain an endless bliss.
For me another widow's kiss
And then a lordly life well earned."

Aeneas was received with friendly affectation,
As if he were king Acest's dearest kin.
He led him to his habitation
And treated him to some fantastic gin.
They served some bacon as a snack,
There was of sausage a neat stack,
A heap of bread was there as well.
The Trojans were fed woodcock meat
And after that each went to his own suite
Located at the building ell.
```

```
Although Aeneas was intoxicated,
He still remained a lucid man.
He was a pious son and dedicated
To his departed father and his clan.
The day his father croaked,
He guzzled too much booze and choked;
That folly caused his premature demise.
Aeneas wished to give a dinner
That beggars should pray for the sinner,
Whom gods should lead to paradise.
```
75.
76.
``` 
I want to commemorate his soul 
By giving dinner to the poor -
Tomorrow - I will not postpone this dole. 
What do you think? Should I abjure?"
That's what the Trojans wanted badly
To hear. They all together hollered madly:
"Aeneas, may good gods help you!
And if you want to know,
Nobody's here your foe,
We want to help you, too!""

78. Next day before the sunrise every man
Was hurrying outside, where in the yard
They made big fire and began
To boil meat chunks in water and in lard.
Five kettles filled with soup were there
And four with dumplings good beyond compare,
At least six pots of borshch with dill,
Besides, huge numbers of cooked rams,
And many chickens, geese, and even clams
For everyone to eat his fill.

79. "Large buckets full of whiskey
    And vats of brandy soon
    Were ready to be drunk; the horde was frisky
    When everyone received a spoon.
    When they were singing ""Rest in peace with saints
    Aeneas cried without restraints.
    The binge began full force. They dined
    Until they could not gulp another bite,
    And could not stand upright.
    The father's soul was not on anybody's mind."

When Venus noticed Dares in that brawl,
She felt a pain inside her head,
She did not like that sight at all
And said to Zeus: "My darling dad!
Give Dares strength, he is my pet,
Lest they humiliate him and upset,
He should defeat his foe, it is imperative,
Because when Dares dies,
The world will nevermind my cries.
Please, make him healthy, let him live!"

You greybeard Neptune, viewing you,
You are a good protector!
You're sitting in the water like a bugaboo
And wrinkled like a spectre!
If you just shook your head
To flood these flames instead,
May your wee trident shatter!
You're quite a profiteer,
To help the poor, you're not a volunteer,
It's not your urgent matter.

They called him Newtes to tease him,
Although Okhrym was his true name,
Was it the people's spite or whim?
I never knew the man or heard about his fame.
He saw Aeneas mad and went
To him in order to prevent
His outburst. Taking hold of his white hand,
He led Aeneas to the hall,
Bowed to his knees just like a thrall
And said to him: ""I do not understand

"Aeneas taking his advice,
Lay down inside the stall.
Although he tried to shut his eyes,
He could not fall asleep at all.
He rolled from side to side,
Then smoked his pipe and sighed,
And only then, exhausted, fell asleep.
He dreamt about his dad, Anchises,
Who came from Hell with some advices,
Because his love for his dear son was deep."

Good-by for now, my precious one!
It starts to dawn around.
Good-by, my child, good-by, my son!"
He sank beneath the surface of the ground.
Aeneas started from his sleep
And, trembling, was up in a leap,
His body was damp from cold sweat.
He gathered his band all together
And ordered them regardless of the weather
To sail, determined and dead set.

As soon as Venus had had seen The Trojans sailing off, She sped to Neptune-kin to intervene Lest he drown them in some deep trough. She traveled in a splendid phaeton Just like a wife of some high army paragon.The fervid horses made the people shivery.She was led by a kozak guard Lest her wild ride be somehow marred;The coachman wore a livery.

Aeneas, seeing such a beauty,
Became unnerved and did not know
Where he arrived. He thought his work and duty
Were lost forever. What a blow!
The scarecrow came to him
And uttered like a cherubim
While parting her blue lips:
"How are you, dear? Long time no see!
Oh, you, Anchises' progeny!"
And put her hands upon her bony hips.

Although I don't go out,
I know a lot about catarrhs,
I help the people who have gout,
And make predictions by the stars.

And readily deliver
From sickness caused by evil eye.
I whisper-cast with melted lead,
i charm the snakes, heal sickness in the head
I rectify what goes awry.

Inside, Aeneas started
To bow to Feb, who looked so grim.
He begged that blessings be imparted
From heaven down on him.
Sivilla changed: her orbs somehow
Crept out onto her brow,
Her hair stood up on end,
Her mouth was frothing,
Her body wildly tossing,
As if the devil made her bend.

Sivilla's babbling stuff.
He clasped his head, stood there and knew
He was fed up and said: ""I've heard enough!
You are annoying me and I
Don't know what you now prophesy'""
He did not like that prattling clod.
'The devil knows who tells the lie,
Perhaps it would not mortify
Me, if I had not begged the god.

Behind them were some holy men,
Who were not interested to see the world,
Which was beyond their surly ken,
Their hands were on their bellies, furled.
They used to passionately pray
And kept strict fasting every other day.
They never loudly cursed mankind,
But criticized while fingering the beads.
Their days were free of sinful deeds,
At night, their passions would unwind.

Just like the sediment that foams in kvass,
Or like fermenting red beets turning sour,
Or like above a field of grass
Flies swarming for many an hour,
So were the souls imploring Charon, the Whim,
Extending their soliciting hands to him
To take them on his boat,
But he remained uncaring,
Barbaric, cold and swearing.
That vicious, dirty goat.
```
198.
``` 
He swung his rudder pole
And pushed it into everybody's snout,
He kept away each soul
That he disliked and oft applied the clout.
And when he had a load,
He grabbed his oar and rowed
Straight to the other shore.
And when it was his whim,
He'd leave a soul out on a limb
To wait a century or more.
